# Export file format

MLflow objects are exported in JSON format.

Each object export file is comprised of three JSON parts:
* system - internal export system information.
* info - custom object information.
* mlflow - MLflow object details from the MLflow REST API endpoint response.

**system**
```

```
"info": {

  "num_ok_runs": 2,
  "num_failed_runs": 0,
  "failed_runs": []

## Sample export JSON files 

### Open source and Databricks MLflow examples

Column legend:
* Basic - Basic default export.
* Src Tags - Import source tags into destination tracking server with `--import-source-tags`.

### Databricks MLflow experiment examples

There are four main types of Databricks experiments: 2 notebooks types (workspace and repo) by 2 experiment types (workspace and notebook).
* Workspace notebook with default notebook experiment.
* Workspace notebook with explictly set workspace experiment.
* Repo notebook with default notebook experiment.
* Repo notebook with explictly set workspace experiment.

|    | Workspace notebook | Repo Notebook |
|----|----|----|
| Notebook experiment | [link](samples/databricks/single/experiments/workspace_notebooks/notebook_experiment) | [link](samples/databricks/single/experiments/repo_notebooks/notebook_experiment) |
| Workspace experiment | [link](samples/databricks/single/experiments/workspace_notebooks/workspace_experiment) | [link](samples/databricks/single/experiments/repo_notebooks/workspace_experiment) |

Other experiment variants are:
* Jobs - experiment created by a job
* AutoML - experiment generated by AutoML
* External MLflow project - experiment generated by OSS [MLflow Project](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html?highlight=mlproject#run-an-mlflow-project-on-databricks) feature with `mlflow run {git-reference}`.
